PIC16F886 Code


Some code samples for the PIC16F886 in C (so far!) for use with the ssdc compiler
from a linux platform. There just isn't enough of this.

This is primarily anything I bother coding. It's not vetted, it may not work.
But take what you can from it!

Contents:
counter - counts up on one set of LEDs and down on another.
clock - A 12hour binary clock. Not very accurate but I'm working on it.
